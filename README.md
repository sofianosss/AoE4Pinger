# AoE4Pinger
Tool helping learn a strategy game called AoE4

This app allows you to import a .TXT file containing a list of tasks and time.

Example:
00:00:01||Scout
00:00:20||Villager
...

In this example, the app will use the TTS engine to read for each line (task) the second column (example "Scout") at the first column time (example 00:00:001).
Then it will do the same for "Villager" after 19 secondes.

The timer starts after double clicking on the button "Starting the game" or you can click once and then when you are ready you give a voice command "Lets go" to start.

In the next version this app should be able to create a list of multiple links to different .TXT files with an icon for each.
It should also be able to have custom voice commands added by the user.
It should also be able to create these .TXT files: Repeating task every X sec, task at X sec and Command with task.
